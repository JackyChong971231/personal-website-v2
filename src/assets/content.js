By project completion, we envision translating sEMG input signal patterns into the movement of a virtual character. Ultimately, our goal is to democratize access to motion capture devices and prosthetic implants, thus reducing barriers to entry in these domains.',

Additionally, a bottom-mounted ultrasonic sensor detects potential emergencies, triggering alerts if necessary. Challenges include motor force limitations and managing interference among multiple sensors.'
